# MadLibs

The Python script serves as a straightforward MadLibs generator that starts by reading a story from a file called 'Story.txt'. It creates a set to store unique placeholders, identified by the characters '<' and '>'. As the script goes through the story, it records the start and end positions of each placeholder, adding them to the set. The user is then asked to provide words for each placeholder, with these responses being saved in a dictionary that associates each placeholder with the corresponding user input. Once all the words are collected, the script replaces the placeholders in the original story using the 'replace()' method. Finally, the updated story is displayed, highlighting the userâ€™s contributions in an enjoyable and personalized way. This interactive approach not only results in a unique narrative but also provides a fun opportunity for users to engage with programming concepts such as file handling, string manipulation, and user input.
